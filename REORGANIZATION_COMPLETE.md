import type { Market, User } from '@/_shared/types';
import { DegenHero2025 } from '@/_shared/components/DegenHero2025';

// ✅ Feature-specific imports (clear separation)
import { MarketCard } from '@/features/markets/components/MarketCard';
import { FeaturedMarket } from '@/features/markets/components/FeaturedMarket';
import { TradingInterface } from '@/features/markets/components/trading/TradingInterface';
import { TradingChart } from '@/features/markets/components/visualizations/TradingChart';

// ✅ Presale feature imports
import { WalletConnection } from '@/features/presale/components/WalletConnection';
import { PresaleNavigation } from '@/features/presale/components/PresaleNavigation';
```

## 🎯 **Development Workflow (Perfect Isolation)**

### **Working on Markets Feature:**
```bash
📁 features/markets/
├── components/
│   ├── MarketCard.tsx           # Market display
│   ├── FeaturedMarket.tsx       # Featured markets
│   ├── trading/                 # All trading components
│   └── visualizations/          # Charts and graphs
├── [id]/                        # Dynamic market pages
├── charts/                      # Charts page
└── page.tsx                     # Markets listing
```

### **Working on Presale Feature:**
```bash
📁 features/presale/
├── components/                  # Presale-specific components
├── dashboard/                   # User dashboard
├── whitelist/                   # Whitelist page
└── page.tsx                     # Main presale page
```

### **Using Global Resources:**
```bash
📁 _shared/
├── components/ui/               # Button, Card, Input, etc.
├── components/layout/           # Footer, Navigation
├── lib/                         # Utilities (cn, debounce, etc.)
├── types/                       # Global types
└── providers/                   # Theme, etc.
```

## üíª **PRIVATE SALE TECHNICAL SETUP** 

### üîß **presale.degenbet.xyz Implementation**

#### **Smart Contract Architecture:**
```solidity
contract PresaleTracker {
    mapping(address => uint256) public contributions;
    mapping(address => uint256) public tokensPurchased;
    mapping(address => bool) public isWhitelisted;
    mapping(address => address) public referrals;
    
    uint256 public constant PRIVATE_SALE_PRICE = 2000000000000000; // 0.002 BNB per DBT
    uint256 public constant MAX_PRIVATE_RAISE = 200000 * 10**18; // $200K in BNB
    uint256 public totalRaised;
    uint256 public tokensSold;
    
    event Purchase(address buyer, uint256 amount, uint256 tokens);
    event Referral(address referrer, address buyer, uint256 bonus);
}
```

#### **Frontend Implementation (presale.degenbet.xyz):**

**1. Wallet Connection:**
- **MetaMask/Trust Wallet** integration
- **WalletConnect** for mobile wallets
- **Auto-detect** BNB Smart Chain network
- **Add BSC network** button if wrong chain

**2. Purchase Flow:**
```javascript
// Purchase tracking system
const handlePurchase = async (bnbAmount) => {
  // 1. Connect wallet
  const account = await connectWallet();
  
  // 2. Check whitelist status
  const isWhitelisted = await checkWhitelist(account);
  
  // 3. Calculate DBT tokens (1 BNB = 500,000 DBT at $0.002)
  const dbtTokens = bnbAmount * 500000;
  
  // 4. Send BNB to presale contract
  const tx = await presaleContract.contribute({
    value: ethers.utils.parseEther(bnbAmount.toString())
  });
  
  // 5. Update local database
  await updateUserContribution(account, bnbAmount, dbtTokens);
  
  // 6. Send confirmation email
  await sendPurchaseConfirmation(account, dbtTokens);
};
```

**3. Payment Tracking Database:**
```sql
CREATE TABLE presale_contributions (
  id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
  wallet_address VARCHAR(42) NOT NULL,
  bnb_amount DECIMAL(18,8) NOT NULL,
  dbt_tokens DECIMAL(18,0) NOT NULL,
  referrer_address VARCHAR(42),
  bonus_tokens DECIMAL(18,0) DEFAULT 0,
  transaction_hash VARCHAR(66),
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
  status ENUM('pending', 'confirmed', 'distributed') DEFAULT 'pending'
);
```

### üéØ **Multi-Wallet Support:**
- **Receive Address**: Your main treasury wallet (multisig recommended)
- **Auto-tracking**: Smart contract logs all contributions
- **Manual backup**: Database tracks wallet ‚Üí contribution mapping
- **Referral system**: Automatic bonus calculation and distribution

## üìà **TOKEN VALUE MAINTENANCE STRATEGY**

### üîí **Pre-DEX Launch Value Protection:**

**1. Limited Early Liquidity (Week 7):**
- **5% of raised funds** ‚Üí Small PancakeSwap pool
- **Initial price**: $0.003-0.005 (natural price discovery)
- **Limited supply**: Only 15M DBT available for trading
- **Purpose**: Let private holders take profits, create FOMO

**2. Controlled Token Release:**
```
Week 7:  15% TGE to private holders = 15M DBT
Week 8:  No new tokens released
Week 9:  Public sale begins (creates buying pressure)
Week 10: Public TGE + full DEX launch
```

**3. Demand Generation:**
- **FOMO campaigns**: "Only 15M DBT available before public sale"
- **Utility activation**: Governance voting goes live
- **Platform beta**: Limited market creation for holders
- **Staking pools**: Immediate 50% APY for early stakers

**4. Supply Shock Tactics:**
- **Burn mechanism**: 10% of public sale tokens burned if sold out
- **Vesting locks**: 85% of tokens still locked during price discovery
- **Whale incentives**: Private holders get bonus for NOT selling
- **Liquidity rewards**: Extra DBT for providing liquidity

### üí∞ **Expected Value Trajectory:**
- **Private Sale**: $0.002 (baseline)
- **Week 7 Launch**: $0.003-0.005 (2.5x potential)
- **Public Sale**: Launch price - 20% discount
- **DEX Launch**: $0.005-0.010 (5x potential from private)
